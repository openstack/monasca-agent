         # The (optional) match_pattern parameter will instruct the check
         # to match the HTTP response body against a regular-expression-
         # compatible pattern.  If the pattern matches the check will
         # return 0 for OK.  Otherwise, it will return 1 for an error

         # the url, reporting the response time in seconds.

#        collect_response_time: true

         # The (optional) disable_ssl_validation will instruct the check
         # to skip the validation of the SSL certificate of the URL being tested.
         # This is mostly useful when checking SSL connections signed with
         # certificates that are not themselves signed by a public authority.

         # The (optional) headers parameter allows you to send extra headers
         # with the request. This is useful for explicitly specifying the host
         # header or perhaps adding headers for authorisation purposes. Note
         # that the http client library converts all headers to lowercase.
         # This is legal according to RFC2616
         # (See: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-4.2)
         # but may be problematic with some HTTP servers
